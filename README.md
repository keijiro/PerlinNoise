Perlin Noise Function for Unity
===============================

This is straight implementation of the Perlin noise function for Unity, which is
based on Perlin's SIGGRAPH 2002 paper "Improving Noise".

You may use the script (Perlin.cs) in your projects freely.

Tips
----

The value range of the noise functions is [-sqrt(n)/2, sqrt(n)/2] where n is the number of dimensions.
For instance 1D Perlin Noise has value range of [-0.5, 0.5]
